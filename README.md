# Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks
This repository is based on the second course (Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization) of the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew NG.  <br>

In this,I implemented methods like gradient checking, droupout, regularization, etc to improve and optimize deep neural networks from scratch.
